When a digital agency is known for many things — usability, user experience, technical expertise — the question becomes: What are we actually best at? Do customers perceive us the same way that we see ourselves? And more importantly: Where should we go next?

That’s the question I asked myself when we were going through a period of reflection and uncertainty. Like many agencies in a highly saturated and fast-evolving market, we were at a crossroads and our main challenge was: how to define a clear, future-oriented strategy in a landscape where competitors are everywhere, and differentiation is hard.

Rather than treating this as a branding or positioning task alone, I decided to approach it from a different perspective and treat the agency itself like a product.

## Step 1: Applying a Product Lens

There are a lot of differences between an agency and classical digital products. In an agency services scale with people therefore the cost and complexity are higher (talent churn, motivation, culture — all directly impact the value), each project is customized and can’t be reused as much, innovation is constrained by client budgets and timelines, monetization is usually hour- or project-based. On the other hand, in the case of a digital product, scalability is easier, the features built serve all users, iteration and rapid prototyping are possible, user feedback is faster and data-driven and pricing can have a fixed model.

While a digital agency isn’t a product in the traditional sense (it’s a service business), applying product thinking can offer clarity and help define a strategy. You shift the view from “we do many things for many clients” to: “what core value do we deliver, to whom, and why do they choose us over others?”.

Having said all that, a digital agency does deliver value to “users” (clients), has competitors, a value proposition, lifecycle phases, positioning, pricing, and experiences market feedback — and these are all elements that can be managed with product thinking. So I tried to answer the following questions by talking to different people in the company:

- Who are we and what is our mission?
- Who is our ideal customer?
- What client problems are we solving or do we offer a solution and are just looking for a problem?
- What do they value most?
- What sets us apart from others?
- Are we trying to be too many things to too many people?
- Where do we outperform competitors — and where don’t we?

##  Step 2: Creating a Research Plan
I created a research plan to lay out the next steps, much like I would for a regular product:

**Internal discovery:** I interviewed people across departments — UX, development, project management, sales — to understand how they see the agency, its strengths, and its challenges. What are our most valuable services? Where do projects succeed or stall? Where do we deliver the most impact?

People seemed to have somewhat different opinions about who we are and where we are headed. On our website we didn’t provide a clear statement about our vision and mission, so besides talking to the founders of the company, I also researched online what others say and think about our agency.

This is the way we see ourselves: we are a small to mid size digital agency that supports big clients in the German market from the B2B and consumer sectors in their digital transformation — from strategy and design to technical implementation. Customer centricity is at the core of our work. Combined with flat structures, interdisciplinary teams, and decentralized decision-making, this allows us to deliver genuine innovation and meaningful solutions to our clients’ problems. I rephrased here a quote by one of the founders.

**Client exploration:** then I gathered input (formally and informally) on how clients perceive us. What made them choose us — and what keeps them from coming back (or not)? What needs are truly met — and which are only partially solved?
As mentioned before, as a digital agency, we mainly served large B2B German companies, especially in traditional industries like manufacturing or engineering. Clients did value the way we worked — the seriosity, the trust, and the collaboration. These values weren’t just internal ideals; they were reflected in how clients experienced us — as structured, professional, and human.

In a market dominated by big, impersonal firms, our commitment to customer centricity — putting real people behind the process — offered clients something many competitors couldn’t: connection, clarity, and care.

But a consistent challenge we encountered was pricing. The level of quality, attention, and service we provide inevitably comes at a cost. The issue became especially clear in pitches, where we often heard: “We liked your ideas, but it’s too expensive.” We were not losing on value, but because of the price expectations dictated by cheaper competitors. What often gets overlooked, though, is the hidden cost of those lower prices. A lot of the time, agencies that win work based only on being cheap, often do so at the expense of quality — relying on overworked teams, understaffed projects, quick-fix solutions, or outsourced execution with less control over outcomes. Larger agencies can afford to offer aggressive pricing because they’re playing a different game: acquiring market share rather than prioritizing quality or long-term client relationships. And in a lot of cases they only offer smaller prices at the beginning,in order to win the contract quickly before expanding the scope and increasing costs later.

And in today’s economic climate, with many clients under pressure to reduce budgets and deliver faster, it’s expected that some will look elsewhere for cheaper alternatives — even if that means sacrificing overall quality and reliability. So how do we continue to deliver meaningful, high-value work while staying competitive in a market that’s increasingly driven by short-term cost-saving decisions? How do we communicate to our client that quality takes time — and that investing in thoughtful, well-executed digital work is not a cost, but a long-term asset?.

One potential solution is to change perspective: instead of thinking “how do we lower our price” to “are we targeting the right market?” If delivering high-quality, user-centric digital solutions is part of our DNA — and not something we want to compromise on — then the solution isn’t to become cheaper or faster at all costs. It’s to get clearer about who we’re for. Focus on those clients who value quality, depth, and collaboration and who see the digital experience as a long-term investment in their brand. In other words, find those who want what we offer and are willing to pay for it.

Competitive analysis: I also looked into other agencies — our size, smaller but also large digital consultancies — to understand how they position themselves, what services they offer, and which segments they serve. I looked for gaps in the market: over-served, under-served, or completely unserved segments where we might have an edge.

Most agencies offered end-to-end services (strategy, design, tech) and highlighted UX as a differentiator (but some agencies integrated it with marketing automation, data, or AI). Other competitors also mentioned customer-centricity and digital transformation just like us. So if we leaned too much on these services, we risked sounding like “just another agency.”

Larger consultancies served enterprise clients, and the public sector, while smaller ones emphasized agility, and design/tech integration. Our agency sat somewhere in the middle. We could still stand apart with UX-first execution plus solid implementation — especially for complex B2B companies who want more than just a project delivery. But we addressed both B2B and consumer markets, which could look like we didn’t have a clear positioning. Still, because most of the agencies out there focused either on design and UX or technical implementation, maybe we could still turn our blend of user-centered design and robust implementation into a unique selling point.

Unfortunately, the reality of the B2B market, especially in traditional industries, is that they don’t necessarily care about or understand usability — or that it could translate into potential leads and sales. In many cases, they simply want a new, modern website or to show that they are in line with digitalization requirements, often more for compliance than for true business impact.

So the question is: how do we make our offer matter to them anyway? One of the ideas I brainstormed was customer portals. Even cost-conscious B2B firms see value if portals are efficient, reduce support calls, and improve client satisfaction. So we could position UX not as an improved design, but as lower support costs and faster adoption. Instead of saying: we’ll give you a great user experience”, say: “we’ll reduce support tickets by 30% through a more intuitive portal.”

Another idea would be data-heavy interfaces like dashboards and internal tools that help employees work faster because of their intuitiveness and ease of use given by a great design.

So instead of selling “UX” (which they might say they don’t need), we could sell business outcomes.

Looking at this from a product thinking perspective, in the end we should not start inventing solutions and go looking for problems. Instead start with the customer’s real problems. Understanding their pain points (by talking to them) and prioritizing those market segments with a real urgency. Industries where digital inefficiencies really hurt the business and cost them money (like manufacturing, logistics, healthcare).

## Conclusions
In the end, the company took a different path due to its acquisition by a bigger group — and so the exercise didn’t result in a new vision or positioning statement. But what I gained was just as valuable: a clearer framework for how to analyze and guide an agency in times of uncertainty.

Had we continued this work, the next step would have been to refine our segmentation and focus on those B2B industries where digital inefficiencies are big pain points. Instead of appealing broadly to “B2B and consumer,” we could have defined a much clearer ideal customer profile. That would have meant looking closely at our most successful past projects, interviewing customers, identifying patterns in industries, company size, and digital maturity, and then aligning our messaging, offers, and acquisition strategy accordingly. Cold calling alone would likely not have been effective — because our target is often decision makers in complex organizations, who have little time and rarely respond to generic outreach (one-size-fits-all messaging). Instead, sales and marketing could have worked together to build targeted contact lists of high-potential companies, research them well beforehand and tailor pitches to their known challenges (Account-based marketing).

Finally, the biggest learning for me was that treating an agency like a product is not about creating a “perfect” strategy once. It’s about building a repeatable process: defining the customer, testing assumptions, analyzing competitors, and iterating. Strategy, like product development, is never finished — it’s an ongoing cycle.
