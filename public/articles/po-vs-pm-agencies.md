Almost every agency job posting includes the word product. Yet once you step into the role, you quickly realise that owning a product and delivering a project are two very different things. Many Product Owners find themselves caught between client expectations, agency processes, and delivery pressures — with little room left for actual product management.

In this article, I want to share my view on why this happens, what consequences it creates, and how agencies (and individuals) might try to bridge the gap.

If you look closely, most agency POs operate more like technical project coordinators: writing or refining Jira tickets, translating client requests into development tasks, maintaining the backlog, ensuring that the sprint stays on track and delivery meets deadlines.

These are important responsibilities — but they focus on output, not outcome. What’s missing is problem discovery, a product vision, strategy, prioritization based on user needs, user research, product analytics and experimentation.

In an agency, these responsibilities often sit with the client. The Product Owner implements, but does not own. And this happens because agencies operate under a service model. They speak in terms of projects, timelines, scopes and contracts and the customer pays for deliverables, fixed scopes and hours. These agencies dominate the market and set client expectations — which reinforces this gap.

A Product Manager on the other hand is accountable for creating a successful product, not just a delivered one. The focus is on understanding the target users deeply, defining the right problems to solve, setting a clear product vision, defining a strategy, validating assumptions through discovery, prioritizing based on impact, measuring success with metrics and continuously iterating. None of these activities cleanly fit into a fixed-price, deadline-driven agency model. Agencies are optimized for projects, not products.

## Why the gap exists — structural causes

Before we talk about how to bridge the gap, we need to be honest about why it exists. The classic agency setup simply isn’t designed for product management. Three realities, in particular, make true product ownership incredibly difficult for agency POs:

- The client owns the product vision and strategy
- The pitch-driven agency model prioritises winning work over product value
- Rapid project cycles discourage long-term product ownership

Agencies move from project to project, contract to contract. Teams work together in one project and then they’re reassigned to something else.This model creates a natural cycle of starting over — new team, new domain, new goals — every few months. But product management relies on continuity: long-term vision, consistent learning, and iterative improvement based on real user behavior. By the time a digital product goes live, the agency team is often already staffed on the next project. The result is a delivery-focused environment where Product Owners rarely experience the ongoing ownership, insight loops, or long-term strategic work. Their role becomes project coordination with “product” as a label.

Agencies are hired to deliver something — not to own its outcomes. Because of this, the success metrics become:

- Did we deliver on time?
- Did we stay within the budget?
- Did we implement everything in scope?

These criteria define whether a project is seen as “successful” from both the client’s and the agency’s perspective. They are also the areas where clients can most easily challenge an agency (or refuse payment), so agencies optimize for these three dimensions above all else. But these metrics have nothing to do with actual product success.

From a product perspective, the real questions should be:

- Did users find what they needed easily?
- Did conversion improve?
- Did customer satisfaction increase?
- Did we solve the underlying problem?
- Did this create measurable business value?

In an agency environment, these questions often receive little attention because nobody is paid to measure what happens after launch, and in many cases there are no metrics in place at all. What matters is that the website looks as expected, doesn’t crash and there are no visible bugs. The agency isn’t motivated to check if the project will deliver meaningful outcomes. As long as the project is delivered “successfully” according to contractual constraints, the job is considered done — even if the actual product impact remains unknown or disappointing.

This makes Product Owners in agencies focus on outputs rather than outcomes, the opposite of what real product management requires.

And part of the reason this happens is that many of the projects agencies take on can’t easily be treated as products in the first place. In the B2B world, a large portion of agency work revolves around creating corporate websites — digital presences that are often purely informational and disconnected from measurable business goals. Their success is rarely tracked, they don’t evolve over time, and they aren’t built with defined user journeys or strategic outcomes in mind.

You can’t really apply product management to something that’s never been defined as a product.

One of the biggest limitations in agency environments is that the immediate client contact is often treated as the ‘user’. Agencies rarely have direct access to the real end-users, which means discovery is filtered through the client’s perspective — a view that is almost always incomplete. In some cases, UX or research teams do get the opportunity to involve a limited number of users, but this usually happens much later in the process, once the client has already decided what they want to build. At that point, usability testing focuses on evaluating different design approaches for a predetermined feature rather than exploring whether the feature is truly needed or what underlying problems users actually face.


This gap between delivery-focused Product Ownership and true product management creates real consequences for the agency itself. Most agencies stay competitive by being faster, cheaper, or more flexible than their competitors. Many clients, especially in B2B, don’t ask for product strategy or measurable outcomes — they simply want something executed. When every agency follows this output-driven model — saying yes quickly, and optimizing for deadlines — the work becomes a generic service. Clients can’t tell the difference between agencies except by price or delivery speed and agencies end up competing in a race to the bottom.

Requirements tend to be incomplete, assumptions remain unvalidated, and features get built without understanding real use cases. This leads to late changes, redesigns, patchwork solutions, and long-term technical debt. Teams spend valuable hours fixing misaligned features. Over time, this forces agencies to rely on high volume rather than quality to stay profitable.

But it’s not always pure execution. During pitches, many agencies invest real effort into shaping creative concepts or proposing thoughtful approaches. But even these ideas usually begin with the client’s predefined request rather than with validated user problems. The agency delivers on the client’s request, but that request is rarely grounded in real discovery. And because clients also often lack deep user insight, both sides end up designing around assumptions. In the pitch environment, success depends more on storytelling, velocity, and price than on real product value.

This dynamic continues during delivery. When a client requests a new feature, the agency team is rarely in a position to challenge whether it’s valuable or aligned with real user needs. Questioning requirements can feel risky when your goal is to maintain the relationship and secure future work.

## How to bridge the gap

1. Introduce a discovery phase

Introducing a discovery phase in a pitch-driven, cost-sensitive environment may sound unrealistic at first. Agencies compete on price and speed, and clients rarely request strategic work upfront. But bridging the PO–PM gap doesn’t require slowing down or adding expensive research phases. It starts with being more selective about which projects to pursue. Most agencies waste enormous amounts of time pitching projects they should never try to win. Product-oriented agencies don’t ‘convert’ clients into product thinkers — they recognize early whether there is space for meaningful collaboration. Warning signs often appear in how a project is framed: when clients insist they already know exactly what needs to be built, focus mainly on internal approvals, show no interest in users or outcomes, or treat delivery as finished once the site goes live. Fixed scope, fixed price, and non-negotiable deadlines leave little room for learning or iteration. Recognizing these signals early helps agencies avoid projects that reinforce an execution-only mindset.

If an agency also pitches projects where discovery is welcome or at least tolerated, they will in the end win fewer pitches, but they will deliver better work and build a reputation for quality rather than price.

The agency doesn’t need a full discovery phase before pitching. They can do simple background research and analyze the client’s current digital presence, identify obvious usability flaws, look at competitors, identify likely user groups, and highlight opportunities they might not see.

Clients rarely ask for strategic work also because agencies rarely offer it convincingly. A pitch that simply outlines pages, components, timelines, design sprints and budget looks identical to 99% of agency pitches. But if you pitch expected measurable improvements, problems you believe could be solved, user journeys you will optimize and the business impact it will make, you can differentiate from the others.

Discovery doesn’t have to mean 6 weeks of research, personas, and interviews. The agency can offer a Discovery package that includes 1–2 workshops — to align on goals, audiences, and success measures — a quick assumption map — to capture what the team thinks they know and identify gaps — a value opportunity analysis — to uncover potential improvements and if possible some user tests — just to validate the direction. Discovery should be positioned as a money saver, not a research phase. In time, the agency could build a reputation for solving real, complex problems rather than simply executing features, by publishing case studies with outcome metrics, showing before/after examples, positioning itself as product-aware and educating clients through content. But the reality is that clients buy certainty, not learning.

The kind of strategy agencies are sometimes hired for is marketing, branding, or SEO related rather than product strategy. These strategic projects focus on positioning, messaging, content planning, and improving search visibility — all important areas that help a company communicate more effectively and attract the right audience. While this work often involves understanding users at a high level, it is not the same as product thinking. Marketing and SEO strategies aim to increase traffic and influence how the brand is seen, whereas product strategy aims to solve real user problems, improve key journeys, and define what should be built next. The two can complement each other, but true product management requires a deeper, problem-solving approach that goes beyond campaigns or content planning. In other words, strategy in an agency context often supports the business around the product, like attracting attention and influencing brand perception, but it doesn’t replace the deeper problem-solving and prioritization that actual product management requires.

2. Make metrics visible

Making metrics visible is one of the simplest ways for agencies to shift conversations from outputs to outcomes. When pitching a full website redesign, talking about generic improvements like ‘better navigation’ or ‘modern UI’ doesn’t help much — clients already expect these basics. What differentiates a pitch is framing the redesign around KPIs that connect directly to business value. Instead of focusing on pages and features, agencies can highlight measurable outcomes such as higher lead conversion rates, better search success, improved content engagement, faster performance, or increased task success for important user journeys. These metrics show that the agency isn’t just proposing a prettier interface, but a website designed to deliver results. Even simple KPIs — like better lead quality, task completion rates, or how easily the client’s team can update and manage website content themselves — can make a pitch feel more focused on real results and on what truly matters to the client.

During implementation, metrics help POs justify decisions based on impact rather than personal preferences. Advising clients to prioritize high-impact features can feel risky in an agency environment where more work often means more revenue. But questioning requests doesn’t have to mean saying ‘no’ — it means reframing the conversation around value. By offering alternatives, using simple, easy-to-collect metrics, suggesting experiments, and guiding clients through prioritization, agencies can deliver better outcomes. When done well, this strengthens the relationship and leads to more sustainable work, not less.

The same principle applies to how agencies approach improvements. Instead of waiting for clients to request features, POs can proactively point out changes that would help, based on common issues they notice. This shifts the role of the agency from passive executor to active partner, showing clients that the team is not just building what is asked but continuously looking for ways to create more value.

3. Shift to retainer-based or product partnership contracts

These don’t need to be large or complex. Even small, continuous agreements — for optimization cycles, post-launch support, experimentation, or roadmap development — create the kind of continuity that traditional projects lack. They reduce risk for the client, strengthen the relationship, and give Product Owners room to think beyond delivery and take on more strategic responsibilities. Of course, some agencies already work with long-term clients on multi-year contracts. But even in these cases, the collaboration often stays transactional: the client requests new features and the agency implements them. A retainer or partnership only creates room for product management if the PO uses that continuity to challenge low-value requests, question assumptions, and guide the client toward meaningful outcomes.

A simple example is to run monthly or quarterly optimization cycles after launch. Instead of treating the website as ‘finished,’ the agency regularly analyzes user behavior, tracks key metrics, identifies 2–3 valuable improvements, tests ideas, and releases incremental enhancements. This shifts the work from a series of feature requests to an ongoing product evolution — but only if the PO actively brings product thinking into the relationship, rather than waiting for the client to dictate what comes next.

A retainer or long-term product partnership doesn’t always need to be sold during the pitch — in many cases, it’s more effective when it evolves naturally during the project. Clients may not be ready to commit upfront, especially when their immediate focus is simply getting the new website delivered. The right moment to introduce an ongoing collaboration is during implementation and especially after launch, when real user behavior becomes visible. As soon as analytics, early feedback, or internal challenges with content updates surface, the agency can highlight opportunities for continuous improvement, framed around keeping the website performing well and adapting to changing needs.

4. Bring user-centric thinking into discussions and use frameworks

Another way to close the gap is to bring more user-centric thinking into everyday discussions, even when there is no time or budget for formal research. Agencies can still map important user journeys, document likely pain points, and challenge the assumptions that are already part of the requirements. Creating simple personas, based on available information or stakeholder input, can help move conversations away from internal opinions and toward how real users might experience the product. These small, low-effort practices introduce product thinking into the process and help POs make more informed recommendations, even within the constraints of an execution-focused environment.

Using simple frameworks would also help to bring more structure into conversations. Tools like RICE for prioritizing features, Jobs to Be Done(JTBD) for clarifying what users are actually trying to accomplish, quick user journey sketches for visualizing problem areas, and hypothesis statements for clarifying assumptions can make discussions more objective and more focused on the outcome. These frameworks are useful in agencies because projects often start with vague requirements, fixed scopes, or feature lists dictated by the client. A PO can use them informally to highlight trade-offs, question requests with low value, or explain why one idea may have more impact than another. They help move decisions from personal opinions to clear, common understanding, making it easier for clients and internal teams to align.

Many agencies can talk product; very few are economically set up to practice it. Agencies rarely transform overnight, and most can’t afford to replace their entire way of working all at once. A more realistic path is a gradual shift that grows alongside the existing delivery model. This kind of change has to start with the right mindset. An agency can only move toward product thinking if it has people who understand it and believe in it. They can start by conducting low-risk research to understand whether there is market interest in a more strategic, product-focused approach and which types of clients might benefit from it. From there, the shift should happen gradually. Start small with a pilot project and a willing client, introduce light discovery, apply simple frameworks, track relevant KPIs, and document the results. Share the progress internally, reflect on what worked, and publish the results as a case study. Over time, this approach can grow organically inside the agency as people see real examples of how product thinking improves outcomes.

## Conclusion

The gap between Product Owners and Product Managers in agencies is real, although not everyone experiences it as a problem. For some, it creates tension; for others, it simply reflects the role they’re happy to play. But it doesn’t have to stay this way.

When agencies bring more product thinking into their processes — even in small, practical ways — the quality of their work improves: clarifying the real problem before jumping into solutions leads to decisions that are more focused, reduces rework, and leads to results that better support users and the business. At the same time, client relationships become stronger because they feel guided rather than simply serviced. When agencies ask thoughtful questions, explain the reasoning behind decisions, and show how choices connect to outcomes, clients gain trust and confidence in the process.

And for POs, adopting a more strategic mindset creates new opportunities for influence, better decision-making, and delivering solutions that better support the client’s real needs. Bridging this gap isn’t about changing job titles; it’s about changing how we approach the work itself.

At the same time, it’s important to be realistic about what this shift means. Pure delivery-focused agencies and product-oriented organizations operate under different constraints and incentives, and they don’t need to become the same thing. The goal isn’t for every agency to suddenly turn into a product company, but to recognize where product thinking can meaningfully improve the work. Even within an execution-driven model, asking better questions, clarifying problems, and making more intentional decisions can raise quality without changing the agency’s core identity. Product thinking doesn’t replace delivery — it strengthens it when applied intentionally and in the right places.
